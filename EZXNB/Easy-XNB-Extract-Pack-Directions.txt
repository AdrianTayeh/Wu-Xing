Unzip the contents of this zip-file to somewhere - I'd recommend unzipping to the StarDew Valley folder.

1. Put your .XNB file(s) you want to modify in the PACKED folder

2. Double click UNPACK FILES.BAT to extract the contents. Everything will go into the UNPACKED folder where you can edit the .PNG files.

3. To re-compile the image. Just double click PACK FILES.BAT, and eveything will compile and overwrite the contents of the PACKED folder.
