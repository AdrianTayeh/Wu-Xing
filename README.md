# What is Wu Xing? 
Wu Xing is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler game in which the player controls Adam. In the game, the world controlled is by 5 
elemental gems: fire :fire:, water :ocean:, earth :mountain:, metal :gear: and wood :evergreen_tree:. When the gems are stolen by thieves, Adam sets himself on a 
journey that takes him to new places inspired from nordic mythology, to return back the elemental gems. 

## Why "Wu Xing"? 
Wu Xing in chinese means "five elements" which is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain the 
world's phenomena.

## Story 
Adam is currently living in China as an exchange student when he meets Xiong Bao. Xiong Bao explains wu xing for Adam, and that the 
five elements of wu xing are represented, here in the physical world, as gems, which he is the keeper of. Unfortunately, four of the five 
gems were stolen, and the separation of the gems will cause the physical world to dissolve out of existence, which Xiong Bao is now, 
several years later, starting to notice.

The thieves, who learned how to channel the power of the gems, travelled to
the different realms, where they built giant fortresses to protect themselves and the gems. 

Xiong Bao is old, and although skillful at controlling the magical capabilities one can achieve by channeling a gem's power, he is not 
exactly fit for fight, and the quest of retrieving the stolen gems is now in your, Adam's, hands.

## Gameplay
Before entering the first floor, the player must choose which element it should fight and which element will aid it during the run. On each 
floor, the player must fight a certain number of enemies in a room before advancing to the next one. To defeat an enemy, player must 
shoot elemental orbs towards the enemies. Once a room is cleared of enemies, it will permanently remain empty. The players health 
points is represented by three hearts, if the player has none left, the game will be over and the player must start over. Each floor has four
bosses which the player must defeat before advancing to the next floor.
